# turingfinal
This is a game created in turing. It is a basic "complete the path" game where the user clicks on a wire and it rotates 90 degrees.
The game has a time limit for all 5 levels, if the user fails to complete the 5 paths in time, they will get a "game-over" message.
During the 2nd-5th levels, after the user clicks a certain number of wires, the computer will randomly select 5-8 wires and put them in a random position.
Gifs, images, and other graphics built into the Turing language were used in this project as well as basic programming techniques (if statements, condition loops, etc.)
(I recieved 100% on the culminative project and it was vote "best-game" by my class mates)
